## Open Source Linux Server Monitoring and Auto Alert System


## üéØ Project Purpose

This system monitors Linux servers‚Äô hardware and service statuses in real-time and sends automatic alerts via Email, Telegram, or Discord when predefined thresholds are exceeded. It is fully open-source and designed to be easily extendable.

**Key Metrics Tracked:**

- CPU usage
    
- RAM usage
    
- Disk usage
    
- Service status (e.g., nginx, postgresql)
    
- Network traffic
    
- SSH brute force attempts

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Task Breakdown

### 1. Monitoring Agent (Client-Side)

- Written in Python using `psutil`, `subprocess`, `socket`.
    
- Outputs system metrics in JSON:
    

```json
{
  "cpu_usage": 63.2,
  "ram_usage": 78.4,
  "disk_usage": { "/": 90.1 },
  "network": { "in": 1500, "out": 2300 },
  "services": { "nginx": "active" },
  "timestamp": "2025-04-10T15:00:00"
}
```

- Configurable via a YAML file.
    
- Sends data to a central server via REST API.

### 2. Central Server (Backend)

- Use FastAPI or Flask.
    
- Stores data in MongoDB.
    
- Uses Celery + Redis for periodic checks.
    
- Sends alerts through Email, Telegram Bot, or Discord Webhook.
    
- Offers APIs like:
    
    - `POST /data`
        
    - `GET /history`

### 3. Web Dashboard (Optional)

- Built with React / Next.js or Vue.js.
    
- Includes:
    
    - Real-time dashboard with graphs
        
    - Alert logs
        
    - Service status display
        
    - Login (JWT Auth)
        

---

### 4. SaaS-Ready Web Interface (Expansion Plan)

- Multi-tenant support
    
- Role-based access control
    
- Server and user alert management
    
- Admin dashboard
    
- Subscription tiers (Free, Pro, Enterprise)
    
- Dockerized deployment for scalability
    

---

### 5. Deployment & Configuration

- Docker support for all components
    
- `.env.example` files for all secrets
    
- Setup script for Telegram and Discord alerts
    
- Comprehensive `README.md`
